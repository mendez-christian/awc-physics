    "text": "Welcome! The purpose of this site is offer a brief overview of the material covered for the following courses at Arizona Western College:\n\nPHY 121: University Physics I (Syllabus)\n\nIntroduction to mechanics. Analysis of the interactions between a system and its environment to determine changes in the system’s position, velocity, momentum, and mechanical energy. Application of Newton’s laws and conservation laws to the behavior of physical systems.\n\nPHY 131: University Physics II (Syllabus)\n\nIntroduction to electricity and magnetism. Application of the laws of electricity and magnetism to the behavior of physical systems.\n\n\nBoth classes use the 9th Edition of Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics by Serway and Jewett. All homework problems are assigned from this textbook.\n\nPHY 121 covers Chapters 1-17 from Physics and Measurements to Sound Waves\nPHY 131 covers Chapters 23-37 from Electric Fields to Wave Optics\nIf time permits, PHY 131 may briefly cover part of the material from Chapter 18 on Standing Waves and Chapter 42 on Atomic Physics\n\nFeel free to check out a recommended list of resources in the Resources tab. Best of luck!"

    "text": "Electrical Charge\nJust like color, density, mass, etc., charge is not a physical object, but rather a property of an object. We use charge to describe how objects interact in an electric and magnetic field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Unit: Coulomb\n\n\n\nThe SI unit for charge is the Coulomb [C].\n\n\nObjects can fall into three main categories:\n\nPositively charged objects have more protons than electrons\nNegatively charged objects have more electrons than protons\nNeutral objects have an equal number of protons and electrons\n\nWe often call protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged) charge carriers, since freely moving electrons are responsible for charge transfer. Below are couple useful parameters for the proton, electron, and neutron:\n\n\n\nParticle\nCharge [C]\nMass [kg]\n\n\n\n\nProton\n\\[ 1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\]\n\\[ 1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\]\n\n\nElectron\n\\[ -1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\]\n\\[ 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\]\n\n\nNeutron\n\\[ 0 \\]\n\\[ 1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental Observation\n\n\n\nOpposite charges attract and like charges repel."
