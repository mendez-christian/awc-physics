## Coulombâ€™s Law

The electric force between two point charges is:

$$
F = k_e \frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}
$$

## Electric Field from a Point Charge

$$
E = \frac{F}{q} = k_e \frac{|q|}{r^2}
$$

## Example Problem

Two charges of ( +3,\mu\text{C} ) and ( -2,\mu\text{C} ) are placed 0.5 m apart. What is the electric field halfway between them?
